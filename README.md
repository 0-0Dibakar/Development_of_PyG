# Development_of_PyG
I developed an PyG is a pure-Python library for creating and modifying graph neural networks (GNNs), built on top of PyTorch and extend PyG such that it is compatible with all other ML frameworks (TensorFlow, JAX, NumPy, etc.)
PyG Multi-Framework Compatibility Project
PyG is a powerful library for creating and modifying graph neural networks (GNNs) using PyTorch. However, this project aims to take PyG to the next level by making it compatible with multiple machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, JAX, NumPy, and more. This compatibility will be achieved by leveraging Ivy's transpiler in the backend.

Project Overview
The primary goals of this project are as follows:

Framework Handler Implementation: Develop a framework handler for PyG that will allow seamless multi-framework support. This handler will enable users to switch between different machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, NumPy, etc.) with ease, providing a consistent interface for graph neural network operations.

Ivy Integration: Implement missing functions in Ivy's backend and frontend so that all functions and operations in PyG can be correctly transpiled. Ivy will play a crucial role in translating PyG's operations into the syntax and functionality of various ML frameworks.

Performance Benchmarks: Showcase the enhanced runtime efficiency of PyG when using different backends. In particular, demonstrate the significant performance improvements achievable with a JAX backend on TPUs compared to the original PyTorch implementation. This will help users understand the advantages of multi-framework compatibility.

Getting Started
To start using PyG with multi-framework support, follow these steps:

Installation: Install the PyG Multi-Framework Compatibility Package using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyg-multiframework
Import PyG: Import PyG and the framework handler in your Python script or notebook:

python
Copy code
import pyg_multiframework as pyg
Framework Selection: Use the framework handler to set the desired backend framework:

python
Copy code
pyg.set_framework('jax')  # Switch to JAX backend
Creating and Modifying GNNs: You can now use PyG as usual to create and modify graph neural networks, and the operations will be translated to the selected backend framework.

implementing a full-fledged framework handler in Python for PyG (PyTorch Geometric) or any other machine learning library can be a complex task and is beyond the scope of a single response. However, I can provide you with a basic example of how you might structure a framework handler to enable simple and intuitive multi-framework support in Python using PyG and TensorFlow as an example.
In this example, we've created a FrameworkHandler class that can load models and perform inference for both PyTorch and TensorFlow. You can extend this class to support other frameworks as needed.
import torch
import tensorflow as tf
from torch_geometric.data import Data
from tensorflow import Graph, Session

class FrameworkHandler:
    def __init__(self, framework):
        self.framework = framework
        self.model = None
        self.graph = None
        self.session = None

    def load_model(self, model_path):
        if self.framework == "pytorch":
            self.model = torch.load(model_path)
        elif self.framework == "tensorflow":
            self.graph = Graph()
            self.session = Session(graph=self.graph)
            with self.graph.as_default():
                saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph(model_path + '.meta')
                saver.restore(self.session, model_path)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported framework")

    def predict(self, input_data):
        if self.framework == "pytorch":
            with torch.no_grad():
                output = self.model(input_data)
        elif self.framework == "tensorflow":
            with self.graph.as_default():
                with self.session.as_default():
                    input_placeholder = self.graph.get_tensor_by_name("input_placeholder:0")
                    output_tensor = self.graph.get_tensor_by_name("output_tensor:0")
                    output = self.session.run(output_tensor, feed_dict={input_placeholder: input_data})
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported framework")
        return output

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an instance of the framework handler
    framework_handler = FrameworkHandler("pytorch")

    # Load a model (provide the correct path to the saved model)
    framework_handler.load_model("path_to_pytorch_model.pth")

    # Create input data (adjust according to your model's input requirements)
    input_data = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)

    # Perform inference
    output = framework_handler.predict(input_data)

    print("Inference Output:", output)
